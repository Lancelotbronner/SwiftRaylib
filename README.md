## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First you'll need to [install raylib as a system library](Raylib/README.md#install-raylib) and [add this package as a dependency](Raylib/README.md#add-swiftraylib-as-a-dependency).

You can then start learning! Check out the [examples] to quickly get an idea and make sure your installation works!

Documentation is available via DocC. For Xcode users simply go to `Product > Build Documentation` or press `âŒƒâ‡§âŒ˜D`. For others the documentation is available in the [releases](https://github.com/Lancelotbronner/SwiftRaylib/releases) as a website you can run locally.
