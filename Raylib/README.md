## üìñ Documentation

Documentation is available via DocC. For Xcode users simply go to `Product > Build Documentation` or press `‚åÉ‚áß‚åòD`. For others the documentation is available in the [releases](https://github.com/Lancelotbronner/SwiftRaylib/releases) as a website you can run locally.

## üèó Installation

### Install Raylib

You should start by installing raylib as a system library. 

The easiest way is via one of the [supported package managers](https://repology.org/project/raylib/versions). Here are a few common examples.

**macOS - Homebrew**
```sh
brew install raylib
```

**Linux - AUR**
```sh
apt-get install raylib
```

**Windows - vcpkg**
```sh
vcpkg install raylib
```

If package managers aren't a possibility, [check raylib's instructions](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation).

### Add SwiftRaylib as a Dependency

Then extend the following lines in your `Package.swift` file or use it to create a new project.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackageName",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Lancelotbronner/SwiftRaylib.git", from: "4.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Raylib", package: "SwiftRaylib"),
            ])
    ]
)
```
