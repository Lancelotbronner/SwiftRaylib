//MARK: - Storage

public struct Storage {
	
	// TODO: Implement persistent storage
	// bool SaveStorageValue(unsigned int position, int value); // Save integer value to storage file (to defined position), returns true on success
	// int LoadStorageValue(unsigned int position); // Load integer value from storage file (from defined position)
	
}

// Maybe making you define Storage properties which will use their global order?
// But what if like, we store strings in there?
// Maybe DataCodable combined with the order thing?

// Maybe just a codable struct which gets stored
